-- AMBITIONS FRAMEWORK - DATABASE MIGRATION CONFIGURATION
-- ===================================================================
-- This configuration file controls the automatic database migration system
-- for the Ambitions framework. The migration system ensures your database
-- schema is always up-to-date with the latest framework version.
--
-- HOW IT WORKS:
-- The migration system automatically detects schema changes and applies
-- them to your database when the resource starts. It tracks applied
-- migrations to prevent duplicate execution and ensures data integrity.

  -- AUTO-MIGRATION SYSTEM
  -- ===================================================================

  --- Enable or disable the auto-migration system
  --- 
  --- • true: Automatically check and apply database migrations
  ---         Recommended for production and development
  ---         Ensures database is always compatible with framework
  --- 
  --- • false: Disable auto-migration system completely
  ---          Use only if you want to manually manage database schema
  ---          NOT recommended unless you're an advanced user
  ---
  --- WARNING: Disabling auto-migration may cause compatibility issues
  --- if your database schema becomes outdated
  enabled = true,

  --- Run migration automatically when resource starts
  --- 
  --- • true: Check and apply migrations on every resource start
  ---         Recommended for most users
  ---         Ensures immediate compatibility on server restart
  --- 
  --- • false: Migration system is enabled but won't run automatically
  ---          You must manually trigger migrations using console commands
  ---          Useful for controlled migration timing in production
  ---
  --- MANUAL COMMANDS (when runOnStart = false):
  --- - ambitions:migrate         (apply pending migrations)
  --- - ambitions:migration-status (check current status)
