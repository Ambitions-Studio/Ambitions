## 🔎 What is Ambitions?

**Ambitions** is the heart of the Ambitions Framework — an open-source, fully custom FiveM framework focused on:
- **Performance & optimization**
- **Modularity & scalability**
- **Security & clean architecture**

Built from scratch with Lua 5.4 standards and a forward-thinking design, it’s ideal for **serious RP servers** seeking quality, structure, and long-term maintainability.

## ⚡ Key Features

- 🔹 **Modern Architecture** — 100% standalone, modular & extensible
- 🔹 **High Performance** — Cleanly threaded with minimal resource usage
- 🔹 **Lua 5.4 Standard** — Constants, annotations, scoped memory
- 🔹 **Community-Ready** — Open for issues, suggestions & pull requests
- 🔹 **No ESX / QBCore Required** — Pure custom foundation
- 🔹 **Designed for MariaDB** — Fully optimized for modern DB environments

## ⚙️ Requirements

To run Ambitions, you’ll need:

| Requirement             | Version / Note                   |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **FiveM Server Artifact** | 12208 or higher                  |
| **Database**             | MariaDB (**not** XAMPP!)         |
| **Management Tool**      | HeidiSQL (recommended)           |
| **OS**                   | Linux or Windows (64-bit)        |

⚠️ **XAMPP is not supported** due to outdated MySQL/MariaDB versions which cause performance and compatibility issues.
